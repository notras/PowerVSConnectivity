# PowerVSConnectivity
Establish connectivity on-premise to PowerVS via IBM Cloud Classic VSRX Gateway

We will realize follwing scenario described in IBM Cloud Documentation
(https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-network-architecture-diagrams#network-reference-architecture-privateipsec)
This is very common scenario and it can be used like general guide for connectivity with IBM Cloud via Ipsec VPN using Juniper VSRX Gateway Appliance
In many situations need Private connectivity from on-Premise environment to Cloud Resources, less expensive option is VPN.
IBM cloud have different zones like modern MZR, classic infrastructure and Power VS colo.
From network perspective need additional actions to interconnect it from one to each other, which is possible via Transit Gateway (TGW) and via Gateway appliance deployed in Classic infrastructure. 

In our cases, main objective was to establish bi-directional connectivity from client on-premise location to PowerVS colo.
It is possible via two options 
 1. VPN GW in VPC + TGW to PowerVS cloud connection 
 2. GW appliance + Power VS cloud connection
 
Option 1. 
imitations:
Need to enable NAT-T on on-premise Gatawey because it is actual limitation of VPC VPN GW
benefits:
no need to manage
HA pair out of the box
low cost

Option 2 
limitations:
Need to order and setup GW appliance
Need to manage it after provisioning 
benefits:
Full control of FW policies and routing

Preffered option in our case was Option 2 (more flexibility in configuration, ability to use GW appliance like central router and firewall between all services deployed on IBM Cloud Account)
